## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea


1: AI-Powered Interview Platform Develop an AI-powered interview platform that simulates real-life interview scenarios. The platform uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to evaluate candidate responses, providing experts with accurate and unbiased assessments. This platform enhances the interview process, making it more efficient and effective.

2: Predictive Analytics for Candidate Selection Develop a predictive analytics platform that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze candidate data and predict their potential for success. The platform provides experts with data-driven insights, enabling them to make informed decisions about candidate selection.

3: Diversity and Inclusion Analytics Develop diversity and inclusion analytics platform that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze candidate data and identify biases. The platform provides experts with data-driven insights, enabling them to make informed decisions about candidate selection and promote diversity and inclusion.

4: Candidate Experience Management Create a candidate experience management platform that uses data analytics and AI to optimize the candidate experience. The platform provides personalized communication, real-time feedback, and tailored recommendations, helping candidates feel more engaged and valued throughout the interview process.

5: Virtual Interview Assistants Develop virtual interview assistants that use natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to provide candidates with real-time feedback and guidance. The assistants help candidates prepare for interviews, answer questions, and negotiate job offers.

6:Feedback and Analytics Develop a real-time feedback and analytics system that provides candidates with instant feedback on their performance. The system uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze candidate responses, offering personalized recommendations for improvement. Experts can access detailed analytics and insights, making informed decisions about candidate selection.
